Says no one ever. So how can we make streets in our favorite city Toronto safer for everyone? This project looks into this problem and provide insights to improve the situation.

Above is a map of where severe collisions happen. Not surprisingly, higher population density, more collisions.

Another important factor is the hour of the day. Most accidents happen in the afternoon, especially around 17:00 and 18:00, when people rush home from work. Based on this observation, Toronto can promote flexible work hours and remote work.
