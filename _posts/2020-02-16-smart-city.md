Sidewalk Labs, Google’s sibling company, is pushing their smart city project in Toronto, hard, yet they have not solved the questions raised by Ann Cavoukian, a privacy expert on data governance.

It has been a long story that started in 2017. When Sidewalk Labs proposed their idea of building Quayside, the biggest ‘smart city’ in North America, on the Toronto Waterfront, it sparked tons of concerns regarding citizen’s privacy among other problems.

Sidewalk Labs violated multiple principles held by Cavoukian, explained in her well-known _Privacy by Design_ framework. _Privacy as the Default Setting_ is the second principle of the framework, it states that NO action is required on the part of the individual to protect their privacy — it is built into the system, by default. Sidewalk Labs violates this rule as they admit that it is hard, if not impossible, to get people’s consent before collecting their information in the public realm. In addition, the project is also against two other principles: _Full Functionality_ and _Respect for User Privacy_. Although Sidewalk Labs promises to strip personal identifiers off collected data, they failed to guarantee that other parties in the project would align themselves with such principles. In other words, unnecessary trade-offs and compromises are made to individuals’ privacy.

Sidewalk Labs, in response to all the critics, released their Master Innovation and Development Plan (MIDP) in June 2019. In MIDP, Sidewalk Labs agrees that Waterfront Toronto, a tri-government organization supervising the Quayside project, would take control of the project in several key areas, including privacy. In October 2019, Sidewalk Labs realigned themselves according to Waterfront Toronto’s 99-page commentary on MIDP. The realignment shows that Sidewalk Labs agrees that personal information will be stored and processed in Canada.

This can be interpreted as a huge win for some privacy advocates. First of all, it seems like Sidewalk Labs is working toward addressing the public’s privacy concerns, and handing the control of the data to the government or an independent trust. Moreover, they specifically referenced de-identification at the source, which is in line with a crucial principle of Cavoukian’s framework - _End-to-End Security_.

The story does not stop there. Just three months ago, Sidewalk Labs submitted their Digital Innovation Appendix (DIA) to Waterfront Toronto on November 15, 2019. DIA emphasized their data minimization, de-identification by default and responsible data use guidelines, including transparency.

Sidewalk Labs has plenty of concerns to address before they can start building the wooden skyscrapers and underground delivery system. They still has a long way to go in order to align themselves with Cavoukian’s framework. The most important concern of Cavoukian is can Sidewalk Labs ensure de-identification at the source, as well as prohibition from re-identification, not only within Sidewalk Labs, but also with third parties? Moreover, companies can possibly benefit from the use of personal information in many more ways beyond advertising, how can they protect citizens from that? Last but not least, are individuals entitled to opt-out of the data collection?

All these important problems need specific plans to be resolved. Yet time is running out fast, Sidewalk Labs has about 3 months until May 20, 2020. to convince the public, then Waterfront Toronto will decide if they can move forward.
