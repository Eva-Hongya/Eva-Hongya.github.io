Attention radio fans, this program takes the radio station call signs you hear, scrapes information of it from Wikipedia and other APIs, and logs it for you.

Here is a sample log generated by this program:

![log1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46429585/80231721-c5468f80-8621-11ea-9c14-daee309d536b.PNG)

#### How to use it

This program is written in Python. To use it, please download the codes <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Eva-Hongya/Radio-Log">here</a>. Note: you will need both `get_info.py` file and `radio_log.py` file.

Here is part of the code I wrote in this project:
```python
#get coords in dd to get distance between radio station and home
radio_coords = get_info.dms2dd(transmitter_coordinates)
distance = geopy.distance.vincenty(my_coords, radio_coords).km
distance = float("{0:.2f}".format(distance))

#day/night and power
#use coordinates to decide local now_sunrise_sunset, then deicde day/night where the user is, then decide power
local_time, sunrise, sunset = get_info.sun(radio_coords)

if local_time < sunrise or local_time > sunset:
    day_night = "Night"
else:
    day_night = "Day"
```

#### Manual input needed
1. Station ID: The AM radio station call sign you hear, for example WBBM (780 AM, a commercial all-news radio station licensed to serve Chicago, Illinois). Example: WBBM.
2. SINPO: A 5 digit number for Signal, Interference, Noise, Propagation, and Overall. Your personal thoughts on the quality of the broadcast, scaling each scale on 1 - 5, 1 being the lowest quality. Example: 45435.
3. Content: The content at the time you hear the broadcast. Example: News.

#### Information scraped from Wikipedia and other APIs
1. Date: The date you log the entry.
2. Time: The time you log the entry.
3. Day/Night: 'Day' if it is before sunset at your local time when you log it, 'Night' if after.
4. City: The city and state/province the radio station is based in.
5. Frequency: The frequency of the radio broadcast.
6. Transmitter Coordinates: The coordinates of the radio transmitter.
7. Distance From Home: Default distance is the radio station's distance(in km) from a general coordinates of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. You can change it to your own coordinates by editing the line 12 of radio_log.py: my_coords = ().
8. Power: The daytime power of radio transmitter in watts.
9. Power/Distance: The ratio of power over distance.

Have fun logging!
